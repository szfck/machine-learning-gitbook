# Logistic Regression

Logistic regression is a learning algorithm used in a supervised learning problem when the output $$y$$ are all either zero or one. The goal of logistic regression is to minimize the error between its predictions and training data.

## Eg. Cat vs No - cat

Given an image represented by a feature vector 𝑥, the algorithm will evaluate the probability of a cat being in that image.


$$
Given \ x, \hat{y} = P(y = 1 | x), where \  0 \leq \hat{y} \leq 1 
$$
