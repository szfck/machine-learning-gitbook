## Bayes Rule

$$
p(c | x) = \frac{p(c)p(x | c)}{p(x)}
$$

### MAP Hypothesis 

In general, to predict the class given example x, we will choose the class with **highest** value for $$p(c | x)$$, this class is called **MAP hypothesis**.

### Maximum Likelyhood

Maximum likelyhood is class with **highest** value for $$p(x | c)$$.
